Aligning memory
 let's say we have threads who load tile work in following manner:

 |AAAA|AABB|BBBB|

 such that A is done by 1 thread and B is done by 2 thread.

 1 takes AABB
 2 takes AABB

 1 works on AA
 2 works on BB

 when both done they return
 1 A'A'BB
 2 A A B'B

 thus overwriting values of each other's work 	

Sound/Music mixing
 frequency - pitch?
 amplitude - volume?
 clipping - wave mixer gets over max amplitude
 16 bit -> 2^16 = 65536 goes 65536 / 2 so from -32k to 32k
 modularity, interpolation ->
