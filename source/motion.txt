 f = m1*m2 / r^2

rigid body dynamics:
 linear
 angular

f = ma

f(t)   = position     = 5t^2 + 2t + 3
f'(t)  = velocity     = 10t + 2
f''(t) = acceleration = 10

t = delta time between frames
p = initial position

acceleration = x,y axis movement (-1..1)

negate diagonal: 
dot_product = dot(accleration)

if (dot_product > 1.0f) 
	acceleration = 1.0f / sqrt(dot_product) * acceleration

acceleration *= movement_speed
acceleration += resistance_coeficient * v

p' = (1/2) * at^2 + vt + p - movement delta
v' = at + v - velocity
new pos = old pos + p'
